random notes
- k get logs -> always check pod ns or any resource logs
- make sure im in the right context k view config
- useful k get resource, may need to specify ns
- need to know resource quotas, volume, replica sets, daemon sets, pods, stateful sets
- get pods for all namespaces - k get pods --all-namespaces
- same goes for delete k delete (specify resource)
- also take a look at cron jobs and regular jobs in kubernetes
- previosly failed pod logs -> kubectl logs nginx -p
