random notes
- k get logs -> always check pod ns or any resource logs
- make sure im in the right context k view config
- useful k get resource, may need to specify ns
- need to know resource quotas, volume, replica sets, daemon sets, pods, stateful sets
- get pods for all namespaces - k get pods --all-namespaces
- same goes for delete k delete (specify resource)
- also take a look at cron jobs and regular jobs in kubernetes
- previosly failed pod logs -> kubectl logs nginx -p
- ways to go into a pod / container
    - k exec -it pod -- /bin/bash
    - k exec -it pod bash
    - multiple containers in a pod
        - same as above just specify -c command for specific container
        - pod designt patterns (side car proxy )
- schedeule certain pods on certain nodes
    - example for gpu resources
        - use nodeSelector
- labels
    - use -l and can also query based on a set of pods that meet a condition
    - example k get pods -l 'environment in (backend)'
    - example k get pods -l app=production
    - to attach labels -> use -l
- show all labels for a pod
    - use --show-labels
    - to overwrite a label use k label resource ... --overwrite
- grep -i 'domskdlfsdk' is useufl in describe
- roll back use undo - to see history use history
- always helpful to use --help
- scale the number of pods in the cluster
    - should either manually update the file
    - or k scale deploy name  --replicas=number
- hpa
    - create a horizontal auto scaler
        - in other words based on certain constrains such as cpu usage
            - control the number of pods that are created
- set image to change the image deployment hmmm
- delete all the resources for hpa and deploy called nginx ->  k delete deploy,hpa nginx
- jobs and cron jobs
    - regular jobs don't have a set schedule
        - example
            -  k create job perl-job --image=perl -- "perl -Mbignum=bpi -wle 'print bpi(2000)'"
        - use activeDeadlineSeconds: ...
            to terminate a task if it takes more than ...
            almost similar to sla
        - job.spec.completions = number of time the task should be complete
    - cron jobs have a set scedeule - know some formats will help
    - generally the '--' means to run a command inside a pod / container
