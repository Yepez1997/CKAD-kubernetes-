random notes
- k get logs -> always check pod ns or any resource logs
- make sure im in the right context k view config
- useful k get resource, may need to specify ns
- need to know resource quotas, volume, replica sets, daemon sets, pods, stateful sets
- get pods for all namespaces - k get pods --all-namespaces
- same goes for delete k delete (specify resource)
- also take a look at cron jobs and regular jobs in kubernetes
- previosly failed pod logs -> kubectl logs nginx -p
- ways to go into a pod / container
    - k exec -it pod -- /bin/bash
    - k exec -it pod bash
    - multiple containers in a pod
        - same as above just specify -c command for specific container
        - pod designt patterns (side car proxy )
- schedeule certain pods on certain nodes
    - example for gpu resources
        - use nodeSelector
- labels
    - use -l and can also query based on a set of pods that meet a condition
    - example k get pods -l 'environment in (backend)'
    - example k get pods -l app=production
